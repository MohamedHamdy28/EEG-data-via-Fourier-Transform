# EEG-data-via-Fourier-Transform
Identify key activity and compare found activity for two different human subjects.

In this assignment you will have to work with EEG data. Your work here is to identify key activity and compare found activity for two different human subjects. You are allowed to use any methods and techniques you learned during the course. Your assignment contains several steps:

- identify redundant channels with no activity and exclude them from next steps,
- from remaining channels select one or two channels with key activity,
- identify key frequencies range,
- identify cortecies or cortex channel or channels correspondent to,
- extract slice of key activity,
- do the same for another file,
- compare extracted slices of key activity using statistical test;
