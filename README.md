# EEG-data-via-Fourier-Transform
Identify key activity and compare found activity for two different human subjects.

- identify redundant channels with no activity and exclude them from next steps,
- from remaining channels select one or two channels with key activity,
- identify key frequencies range,
- identify cortecies or cortex channel or channels correspondent to,
- extract slice of key activity,
- do the same for another file,
- compare extracted slices of key activity using statistical test;
